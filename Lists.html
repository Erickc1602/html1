    <ul>This exercise is about making lists </ul>
    <ul>Here's what i like about lists: </ul>
    <ul>• They're useful for displaying lists of stuff </ul>
    <ul>• That's about it </Ul>
    <ul>• I'm gonna put another list in her because doing things in threes is cool </ul>
    <ul>When you make a list, do it in this order: </ul>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
    <ol>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</ol>
    <li>Curve ball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
